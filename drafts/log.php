	<p class="bkg_white"><strong>01</strong> - Wednesday, March 5, 2014 - Original Draft: It's a starting point. Will work more on idea and dial it in if you're ok with the direction. Essentially there will be a homepage (what you see in the picture), a menu page and a map/phone number page.</p>

    <p class="bkg_gray"><strong>02</strong> - Bumped up the psychedelic.</p>
    <p class="bkg_white"><strong>03</strong> - Just creating another canvas to mess around with. If you haven't gotten an email from me saying, &quot;Hey, check out #3&quot; then this is supposed to be happening behind the scenes and don't take anything you see here to suggest this is the direction I am headed.</p>
